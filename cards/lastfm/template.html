<h2 class="subheader">Last.fm</h2>
<p>I like music. <a href="http://last.fm">Last.fm</a> is a site that lets me keep stats on my music listening. You can see my account and listening habits <a href="http://last.fm/user/iandioch">here</a>.</p>
<p>The last song I scrobbled was <span class="b">{{ last_song_title }}</span> by <span class="b">{{ last_song_artist }}</span> at {{ last_song_date }}. My most-listened-to artists are <span class="b">{{ top_artist0 }}</span> (with {{ top_artist0_plays }} plays), <span class="b">{{ top_artist1 }}</span> ({{top_artist1_plays}} plays), and <span class="b">{{ top_artist2 }}</span> ({{ top_artist2_plays}} plays).</p>
