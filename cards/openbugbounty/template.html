<h2 class="subheader">Bug Bounty Hunting</h2>
<p>I have dipped my toes into the world of infosec by searching out cross-site scripting vulnerabilities and reporting them on <a href="https://www.openbugbounty.org">OpenBugBounty</a>. This site verifies the vulnerability and provides a coordinated disclosure system.</p>
<p>I have reported {{ num_vulns }} XSS vulnerabilities there, of which {{ num_vip }} were on VIP sites (the most popular 50k websites by Alexa ranking). I have been the Top VIP Security Researcher of the Week {{ num_top_vip_of_week }} times. You can see my profile <a href="https://www.openbugbounty.org/researchers/iandioch/">here</a>.</p>
