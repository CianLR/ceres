<h2 class="white-70 f2">Project Euler</h2>
<p>I have completed a lot of Project Euler problems, and am in the top 15 users in Ireland, and the top 1% worldwide. I upload my solutions to <a href="https://github.com/iandioch/solutions" class="link white-70">a github repo</a>, in which I have {{ num_solutions }} solutions to {{ num_problems }}, with the majority of solutions in {{ lang0 }} ({{ num_lang0 }} solutions), {{ lang1 }} ({{ num_lang1 }} solutions), and {{ lang2 }} ({{ num_lang2 }} solutions).</p>
